To run this code, execute the track_movement() function with the path 
to the images and cam.mat and how many RANSAC iterations (I've found 
1000 to be a reasonable choice with my code.)

This code relies on my earlier version of the feature finding/tracking
code (which I just discovered apparently puts out strange results/doesn't
work, so I'll need to resubmit that.) Which might explain why I have 
a bizarre robot track.

I poked around and decided that 1000 iterations gave me results comperable
to the 10000 iterations, so I decided that 1000 was good enough.  I don't
do much thresholding (excluding what I have in my feature finding code),
but I do only use sets of features in my calculation of E where all
of the coorespondences have the same cheirality, and generally there 
are only a half dozen to a dozen of these found in each 1000 iterations
per image coorespondences.  Because of this few number, I just find
the one that has the minimum distance between expected and actual
normalized points.
