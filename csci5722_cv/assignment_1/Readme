    To run this, execute the cat_assign.m script.  It is rather hackish, because it will look for 13 files of each of the 
various kinds with specific names in ‘/home/beldyk/Desktop’ modify the path variable to modify this.

    Firstly, the code is wrong.  It’s not that wrong (I don’t think) but the cat looks like it is on a weird slant.  
If you plot the cat with mesh(dpth) it looks very slanty, but if you plot with surface(dpth) it looks downright reasonable.  
I’m pretty confident my functions that find the nearest sphere pixels for each cat pixel work, and my various mapping functions 
do as well.  I’m pretty sure my issue is with my functions that calculate the normals for the spheres.  I figure with a little 
more time, I could fix this, I’m pretty sure it is not a big deal, but I don’t know for sure (and I’m just out of time.)

    I also had some quirks around the edges of both the cat and spheres.  Normals keep wanting to slide to NaN and Infinity.  
I’ve changed my is_masked() function to look for values of 255 instead of >0 to step away for the edges a little.
