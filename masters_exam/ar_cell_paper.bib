Combined with head position sensing and a real world registration system, this technology allows a computer-produced diagram to be superimposed and stabilized on a specific position on a real-world object. Successful development of the HUDset technology will enable cost reductions and efficiency improvements in many of the human-involved operations in aircraft manufacturing, by eliminating templates, formboard diagrams, and other masking devices}},

abstract ={We have built an outdoors augmented reality system for mobile phones that matches camera-phone images against a large database of location-tagged images using a robust image retrieval algorithm. We avoid network latency by implementing the algorithm on the phone and deliver excellent performance by adapting a state-of-the-art image retrieval algorithm based on robust local descriptors. Matching is performed against a database of highly relevant features, which is continuously updated to reflect changes in the environment. We achieve fast updates and scalability by pruning of irrelevant features based on proximity to the user. By compressing and incrementally updating the features stored on the phone we make the system amenable to low-bandwidth wireless connections. We demonstrate system robustness on a dataset of location-tagged images and show a smart-phone implementation that achieves a high image matching rate while operating in near real-time.},

It will present examples of state-of-the-art display configurations, appropriate real-time rendering techniques, details about hardware and software implementations, and current areas of application. Specifically, it will describe techniques for optical combination using single/multiple spatially aligned mirror-beam splitters, image sources, transparent screens and optical holograms. Furthermore, it presents techniques for projectorbased augmentation of geometrically complex and textured display surfaces, and (along with optical combination) methods for achieving consistent illumination and occlusion effects. Emerging technologies that have the potential of enhancing future augmented reality displays will be surveyed.},

We will further show how these approaches are applied to three pervasive AR games and draw conclusions regarding the future requirements regarding the support of this type of games.},

     abstract={Augmented Reality overlaps virtual objects on real world. It mixes a real and virtual world which can generate more semantic meanings than either one. To seamlessly merge virtual and real objects, model registration is an important problem. This paper provides a practical approach to do occlusion registration which is a key cue for users to understand the scene. We apply our method to Video-based Augmented Reality where detecting occlusion relationship is challenging because virtual objects are simply superimposed on images of real scenes. By estimating the dense depth of real objects from stereo, results show our approach can efficiently and correctly register virtual and real objects.},

Camera-equipped cell phones with significant processing power and graphics abilities provide an inexpensive and versatile platform for AR applications, while the social networking technology of Web 2.0 provides a large-scale infrastructure for collaboratively producing and distributing geo-referenced AR content. This combination of widely used mobile hardware and Web 2.0 software allows the development of a new type of AR platform that can be used on a global scale. In this paper we describe the Augmented Reality 2.0 concept and present existing work on mobile AR and web technologies that could be used to create AR 2.0 applications.},

It surveys mobile augmented reality systems challenges and requirements for successful mobile systems. This paper summarizes the current applications of Augmented Reality and speculates on future applications and where current research will lead Augmented Reality’s development. Challenges augmented reality is facing in each of these applications to go from the laboratories to the industry, as well as the future challenges we can forecast are also discussed in this paper. Section 1 gives an introduction to what Augmented Reality is and the motivations for developing this technology. Section 2 discusses Augmented Reality Technologies with computer vision methods, AR devices, interfaces and systems, and visualization tools. The mobile and wireless systems for Augmented Reality are discussed in Section 3. Four classes of current applications that have been explored are described in Section 4. These applications were chosen as they are the most famous type of applications encountered when researching AR apps. The future of augmented reality and the challenges they will be facing are discussed in Section 5.},

Such an augmented reality computer-mediated learning system has been developed as part of an EU funded research project, namely the CONNECT project. The CONNECT project brings together schools and science centres, and produces novel information and communication technologies based on augmented reality (AR) and web-based streaming and communication, in order to support learning in a variety of settings. The CONNECT AR interactive learning environment can assist users to better contextualize and reinforce their learning in school and in other settings where people learn (i.e. science centres and home). The CONNECT concept and associated technologies encourage users to visit science centres and perform experiments that are not possible in school. They can also build on these experiences back at school and at home with visual augmentations that they are communicated through web-based streaming technology. This paper particularly focuses on a user-centred evaluation approach of human factors and pedagogical aspects of the CONNECT system, as applied to a special needs user group. The main focus of the paper is on highlighting the human factors issues and challenges, in terms of wearability and technology acceptance, while elaborating on some qualitative aspects of the pedagogical effectiveness of the instructional medium that AR technology offers for this group of learners.},

This allows improvements in diagnosis and treatment of patients. For the patient, this technology offers benefits and further potential in therapy, rehabilitation and diagnosis, and explanation. Applications across the whole range of functions that affect the health sector from the physician, the medical student, to the patients are possible. However, the quality of the work of medical professionals is considerably influenced by both usefulness and usability of technology. Consequently, key issues in developing such applications are the tracking methodology, the display technology and most of all ensuring good usability. There have been several research groups who extended the state of the art in employing these technologies in the medical domain. However, only a few are addressing issues of Human-Computer Interaction, Interaction Design, and Usability Engineering. This paper provides a brief overview over the history and the most recent developments in this domain with a special focus on issues of user-centered development.},

Consequently, the scale of collaborative multi-user experiments have not yet exceeded a handful of participants.

We implemented a four-user interactive game installation as an evaluation setup to encourage playful engagement of participants in a cooperative task.
