My final system ended up being fairly simple:
Porter snowball stemmer
A minimal amount of field boosting
    M = 1
    T  = 0.6
    S = 0.0
A custom set of stop words (the top 60 words from the docs prepended to ENGLISH_STOP_WORDS_SET)
And a hand tuned set of synonyms for query expansion (see Synonymify.java)
All of which led up to an R-precision of 41.719.

My basic experimental method was to take a single value (the field boost of T, for example) and play with different values looking for a value that gave me the highest value.  I played with the number of stop words and the field boosting initially, which gave me an R-precision of 37.96

Then I began to play with synonyms.  I decided upon query expansion (mainly because it seemed easier to code.)  I’d pick a query with no results, and look at the query vs the contents of the documents to pick out some synonyms (frankly, manually attempting to find a term that found the proper documents but didn’t give too many false positives.)  This gave me my 41.719 value.

I am also well aware that I completely overfit to the dataset, but that was the assignment.
